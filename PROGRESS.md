## 2026-09-14 — Spec 017 closure review and GitHub progress workflow

**Request:** read the existing analysis, continue the closure review, fix
errors, preserve progress on GitHub, inherit skills/memory, and never merge
without an explicit instruction.

**Branch:** `arena/01a09c1e-hermes-rust-version` (base `6ded9dd`).

### Inherited context and skills

Read `AGENTS.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `docs/agents/{issue-tracker,triage-labels,domain}.md`,
ADRs 0001/0002/0006, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/PARITY.md`, the relevant
`docs/HERMES_UI_SPEC.md` sections, and Spec 017 T08/T10/board notes.
The user's commit/push and memory-inheritance rules are now durable in
`AGENTS.md`, `MEMORY.md`, and the `progress-handoff` skill. No external
`~/.hermes` skill/memory installation exists in this sandbox; no import or
modification of Python Hermes is claimed.

### Changes

- Fixed CI's swallowed rustfmt failure: pipefail, fmt outcome, always-run
  final gate, and format diagnostics. Added three workflow regression tests
  and a separate CI job to run them on subsequent pushes.
- Corrected outdated parity claims (FTS5/function calling, default-on CLI
  sandbox, 101 upstream + 14 Rust completion entries, reference path).
- Kept closure sign-off open: existing PTY/unit evidence is not automatically
  a replacement for the complete §J.7 capture requirement.
- Added the detailed review ticket:
  `.scratch/hermes-rs-total-parity/issues/T11-closure-review.md`.
- No runtime Rust code or Python Hermes data changed in this checkpoint.

### Verification actually performed

- Three local workflow regression tests passed, including 125 gate-outcome
  tuples, format exit status 0/1/42, log retention, and diagnostics.
- Reproduced the old bug with a failing fake cargo: old pipeline exit 0,
  corrected pipeline exit 1. This is a workflow test, not a rustfmt run.
- YAML parse, workflow shell syntax, reviewed document links, source catalog
  counts, and `git diff --check` passed during the initial review.
- Historical GitHub job `103764353101`: summary annotations confirm 576
  tests passed and clippy success. Not a run of this checkpoint.

### Blockers / next actions

- Local Rust toolchain unavailable. Official rustup/static downloads failed
  TLS; retry and mirror access also failed. Debian apt indexes could not be
  downloaded. No successful Rust build/test/format check is claimed.
- Save this checkpoint to the assigned branch, then inspect that commit's
  CI using `gh`. Fix reported failures without weakening checks. Record the
  actual push/CI result in the next entry, not as a prediction here.
- Visual §J.7 evidence or explicit reviewer approval remains required.
- No merge or auto-merge is authorized. No PR has been opened in this session.
