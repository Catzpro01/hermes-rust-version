## 2026-09-14 — Spec 017 closure review and GitHub progress workflow

**Request:** read the existing analysis, continue the closure review, fix
errors, preserve progress on GitHub, inherit skills/memory, and never merge
without an explicit instruction.

**Branch:** `arena/01a09c1e-hermes-rust-version` (base `6ded9dd`).

### Inherited context and skills

Read `AGENTS.md`, `CONTEXT.md`, `docs/agents/{issue-tracker,triage-labels,domain}.md`,
ADRs 0001/0002/0006, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, `docs/PARITY.md`, the relevant
`docs/HERMES_UI_SPEC.md` sections, and Spec 017 T08/T10/board notes.
The user's commit/push and memory-inheritance rules are now durable in
`AGENTS.md`, `MEMORY.md`, and the `progress-handoff` skill. No external
`~/.hermes` skill/memory installation exists in this sandbox; no import or
modification of Python Hermes is claimed.

### Changes

- Fixed CI's swallowed rustfmt failure: pipefail, fmt outcome, always-run
  final gate, and format diagnostics. Added three workflow regression tests
  and a separate CI job to run them on subsequent pushes.
- Corrected outdated parity claims (FTS5/function calling, default-on CLI
  sandbox, 101 upstream + 14 Rust completion entries, reference path).
- Kept closure sign-off open: existing PTY/unit evidence is not automatically
  a replacement for the complete §J.7 capture requirement.
- Added the detailed review ticket:
  `.scratch/hermes-rs-total-parity/issues/T11-closure-review.md`.
- No runtime Rust code or Python Hermes data changed in this checkpoint.

### Verification actually performed

- Three local workflow regression tests passed, including 125 gate-outcome
  tuples, format exit status 0/1/42, log retention, and diagnostics.
- Reproduced the old bug with a failing fake cargo: old pipeline exit 0,
  corrected pipeline exit 1. This is a workflow test, not a rustfmt run.
- YAML parse, workflow shell syntax, reviewed document links, source catalog
  counts, and `git diff --check` passed during the initial review.
- Historical GitHub job `103764353101`: summary annotations confirm 576
  tests passed and clippy success. Not a run of this checkpoint.

### Blockers / next actions

- Local Rust toolchain unavailable. Official rustup/static downloads failed
  TLS; retry and mirror access also failed. Debian apt indexes could not be
  downloaded. No successful Rust build/test/format check is claimed.
- Save this checkpoint to the assigned branch, then inspect that commit's
  CI using `gh`. Fix reported failures without weakening checks. Record the
  actual push/CI result in the next entry, not as a prediction here.
- Visual §J.7 evidence or explicit reviewer approval remains required.
- No merge or auto-merge is authorized. No PR has been opened in this session.

## 2026-09-14 — Checkpoint pushed; genuine format failure exposed

- Commit `52a5fba` pushed successfully to the assigned branch; remote HEAD
  was verified as `52a5fba2c3b73c544859318b4bc1627d76101078`.
- CI run [34776587517](https://github.com/Catzpro01/hermes-rust-version/actions/runs/34776587517)
  failed correctly: annotations report `fmt=failure clippy=success test=success`.
  All **576 Rust tests** passed; the workflow regression job also passed.
- The new gate exposed pre-existing Rust formatting drift, beginning in
  `approval.rs`; the old `|| true` had hidden it. Do not disable the gate.
- The diagnostics also incorrectly called successful SIGINT test output
  (`error: interrupted`) a build failure. Restrict test-build annotations
  to failed test steps and retain a regression for genuine compiler errors.
- Signed artifact/raw log downloads are blocked (EOF), and local Rust
  downloads remain unavailable. Add a formatting-recovery step on the
  GitHub runner: run `cargo fmt --all`, verify formatting, run `cargo check`,
  and export a tracked-Rust-only patch as artifact plus compressed,
  checksummed annotations. It does **not** commit/push or mask the original
  failed check. The patch must be decoded, hash-checked, and reviewed locally.
- Next: push this diagnostics/recovery checkpoint, retrieve its verified
  formatting patch, review/apply it, commit with progress, and rerun CI.
  No merge is authorized or performed.

## 2026-09-14 — Recovery export transport correction

- Checkpoint `b1c8d5c` was pushed. CI run
  [34776704677](https://github.com/Catzpro01/hermes-rust-version/actions/runs/34776704677)
  completed: five workflow regression tests passed, clippy and all 576 Rust
  tests passed, and the recovery step successfully ran `cargo fmt --all`,
  `cargo fmt --all -- --check`, and `cargo check --workspace --locked`.
  The overall job still correctly failed its original fmt check.
- False `test-build` annotations for successful SIGINT tests are gone.
- Patch retrieval exposed another concrete error: the API/proxy truncated
  each 48,000-character annotation to 4,096 characters. Gzip validation
  rejected the incomplete data; **no corrupt patch was applied**.
- Reduce encoded patch parts to 3,000 characters (maximum 40 parts) and
  extend the regression with multi-part, poorly compressible content.
  Preserve checksum validation before applying any remote patch.
- Next: push the corrected exporter, fetch complete parts, verify checksum,
  inspect/apply the Rust-only patch, and rerun CI. No merge performed.

## 2026-09-14 — Respect Actions' per-step annotation quota

- Checkpoint `fe8c5f8` pushed; run
  [34776815998](https://github.com/Catzpro01/hermes-rust-version/actions/runs/34776815998)
  again passed clippy/576 tests and verified the formatted workspace with
  `cargo check`. The five QA tests passed. Original fmt failure stays visible.
- The complete patch is 274,328 bytes (26 compressed parts). Individual
  3,000-character parts now survive the API, but Actions retained only the
  first ten notices in the exporter step (digest + nine parts).
  Completeness validation rejected retrieval; no incomplete patch applied.
- Split export into groups of eight parts across separate workflow steps,
  leaving room for the digest within the per-step quota. Extend the test
  past eight parts and assert per-step notice and per-part size bounds.
- The sandbox's `gh` lacks `--slurp`; use `gh api .../annotations?per_page=100`
  and validate part indices plus digest when retrieving the patch.
- Next action remains checksum-verified patch application, then fresh CI.
  No merge or auto-merge has been performed.
